        <p><em>Cricket is a popular team sport played in many countries around the world, particularly in countries like India, England, Australia, Pakistan, and others. It is known for its rich history, complex rules, and passionate fan base. Cricket is played between two teams, each consisting of 11 players. The objective is for one team to score more runs than the other. The game is typically played over the course of one or more days or in a shorter format called limited-overs cricket, which includes One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 (T20) matches.</em></p>
